## 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

### Phase Flow with Streaming

```python
async def run_full_cycle(owner_request):
    # ANALYTIC PHASE (5 → 100% progress)
    async for update in run_analytic_phase(owner_request):
        # Streams:
        # - phase_start
        # - activity updates
        # - task_type_determined
        # - coordination_points identified
        # - scope_strategy developed
        # - phase_complete with Analysis Report
        yield update
    
    # PLANNING PHASE (5 → 100% progress)
    async for update in run_planning_phase(analysis_report):
        # Streams:
        # - phase_start
        # - objectives_created
        # - waves_created
        # - scope_validated (CRITICAL!)
        # - phase_complete with Coordination Plan
        yield update
    
    # POST-EXECUTION
    # Generates Accomplishment Report with commit message
    yield cycle_complete
```

### Scope Validation Algorithm (Implemented!)

```python
async def validate_scope_exclusivity(objectives) -> Dict:
    """
    Implements AP.md Section 2.2 algorithm
    
    For each wave W:
      For each pair (T1, T2) in wave W:
        If T1.SCOPE_TOUCH ∩ T2.SCOPE_TOUCH ≠ ∅:
          CONFLICT!
    
    Returns:
      {
        'valid': bool,
        'conflicts': [...]
      }
    """
    conflicts = []
    
    # Group by wave
    waves = {}
    for obj in objectives:
        wave_num = obj.get('wave', 1)
        waves.setdefault(wave_num, []).append(obj)
    
    # Check each wave
    for wave_num, wave_objs in waves.items():
        for i, obj1 in enumerate(wave_objs):
            scope1 = set(obj1.get('scope_touch', []))
            
            for obj2 in wave_objs[i+1:]:
                scope2 = set(obj2.get('scope_touch', []))
                overlap = scope1 & scope2
                
                if overlap:
                    conflicts.append({
                        'wave': wave_num,
                        'objective1': obj1['title'],
                        'objective2': obj2['title'],
                        'overlap': list(overlap)
                    })
    
    return {
        'valid': len(conflicts) == 0,
        'conflicts': conflicts
    }
```

### Tools Available to Orchestrator

```python
class OrchestratorTools:
    """Tools for orchestrator's reasoning"""
    
    async def analyze_codebase(path) -> CodebaseStructure:
        """Analyze project structure"""
        # Returns: modules, entry_points, test_dirs, config_files
    
    async def validate_scope_exclusivity(objectives) -> Dict:
        """Mathematical validation of scope allocation"""
        # Returns: {valid: bool, conflicts: [...]}
    
    async def list_workers(team_config) -> List[Dict]:
        """List available workers from team.json"""
        # Returns: [{id, type, capabilities, ...}]
```

## 🎨 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Real-Time Streaming
Every phase streams progress updates:
```python
yield {'type': 'activity', 'activity': 'Analyzing...', 'progress': 20}
yield {'type': 'codebase_analyzed', 'modules': 15}
yield {'type': 'scope_validated', 'valid': True}
yield {'type': 'phase_complete', 'report': {...}}
```

### 2. Self-Monitoring
Orchestrator tracks its own state:
```python
@dataclass
class OrchestratorStatus:
    phase: OrchestratorPhase  # ANALYTIC, PLANNING, etc.
    progress_percent: int
    current_activity: str
    elapsed_time: float
    estimated_remaining: Optional[float]
```

### 3. Automatic Documentation
Every phase auto-generates markdown:
- **Analysis Report** → `docs/analyses/ANALYSIS_*.md`
- **Coordination Plan** → `docs/plans/PLAN_*.md`
- **Accomplishment Report** → `docs/accomplishments/ACCOMPLISHMENT_*.md`

### 4. Scope Conflict Resolution
If conflicts detected:
```python
if not validation['valid']:
    # Automatically resolve by moving to next wave
    objectives = resolve_scope_conflicts(objectives, validation)
    # Re-validate
    validation = validate_scope_exclusivity(objectives)
```

## 🔮 What's Next (Phase 3)

### Worker Execution Implementation

```python
# Phase 3: EXECUTION PHASE
async def run_execution_phase(plan: CoordinationPlan):
    """
    Execute coordination plan with real workers
    
    1. Initialize MCP connections to workers
    2. For each wave:
       - Dispatch objectives to workers in parallel
       - Monitor worker progress (streaming)
       - Collect diffs and results
    3. Validate integration contracts
    4. Run quality gates
    5. Generate final accomplishment
    """
    
    # Initialize worker connections
    worker_connections = await init_worker_mcps(team_config)
    
    # Execute waves
    for wave_num, wave_objectives in enumerate(plan.waves, 1):
        # Dispatch in parallel
        tasks = [
            dispatch_to_worker(obj, worker_connections)
            for obj in wave_objectives
        ]
        
        # Monitor and collect
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        
        # Validate integration
        validate_integration_contracts(results, plan.contracts)
    
    # Generate accomplishment
    return create_accomplishment_report(results)
```

### Integration with mcp-use

```python
from mcp_use import MCPClient, MCPAgent

# Connect to worker MCP servers
worker_client = MCPClient(config={
    "mcpServers": {
        "claude-worker": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@anthropic-ai/claude-mcp"]
        },
        # ... more workers
    }
})

# Dispatch task to worker
result = await worker_client.call_tool(
    server_name="claude-worker",
    tool_name="execute_ap_task",
    arguments={"prompt": ap_prompt}
)
```

## 🎉 Why This Matters

Phase 2 demonstrates the **novel coordination approach**:

1. **Analytic Programming in Action**
   - Not task planning, but coordination analysis
   - Identifies what needs to coordinate, not how to implement
   - Allocates exclusive scopes mathematically

2. **Real-Time Transparency**
   - Every phase streams its thinking
   - Owner sees orchestrator's reasoning
   - Complete audit trail

3. **Self-Documenting System**
   - Every session produces three documents
   - Analysis → Plan → Accomplishment
   - Future agents learn from history

4. **Mathematical Guarantees**
   - Scope validation provably correct
   - Zero merge conflicts by design
   - True parallelism without coordination overhead

---

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 3

Foundation is solid:
- ✅ Data structures defined
- ✅ Documentation system complete
- ✅ Streaming infrastructure ready
- ✅ Scope validation implemented
- ✅ Persistence layer working

Next: Connect to real worker agents via MCP!
