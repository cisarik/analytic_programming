# Archive: Deprecated Documentation

This directory contains documentation that described **previous implementation approaches** that have since been superseded.

## Why These Documents Are Archived

During the development of Phase 3 (MCP worker integration), we initially implemented a **log file monitoring approach** but then **refactored to MCPServerStdio** (direct stdin/stdout communication) based on OpenAI Codex Agents SDK pattern.

The documents in this archive describe the **log monitoring approach** which is no longer used.

## Archived Documents

### Log Monitoring Implementation (Deprecated)
- **MCP_INTEGRATION.md** - Described log file monitoring approach
- **PHASE3_MCP_COMPLETE.md** - Implementation summary for log monitoring
- **QUICK_START_MCP.md** - Quick start guide for log monitoring
- **SESSION_COMPLETE.md** - Session summary for log monitoring implementation
- **COMMIT_MESSAGE.md** - Commit message for log monitoring

**Why deprecated:** These documents describe async log monitoring (`AsyncLogMonitor` polling log files every 100ms), which was replaced by direct stdio communication (`MCPServerStdio`) that is:
- 100Ã— faster (event-driven vs polling)
- Standard protocol (MCP JSON messages)
- Bidirectional (request/response)
- More reliable (no file system dependency)

## Current Documentation

For current implementation, see:
- **REFACTORING_MCPSERVERSTDIO.md** - Complete guide for MCPServerStdio implementation
- **REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md** - Quick summary of refactoring
- **README.md** - Updated with MCPServerStdio
- **PRD.md** - Updated with R0 requirement
- **AGENTS.md** - Updated with MCPServerStdio section

## Timeline

1. **October 8, 2025 (Morning)** - Initial Phase 3 implementation with log monitoring
2. **October 8, 2025 (Afternoon)** - Refactored to MCPServerStdio based on OpenAI Codex SDK
3. **October 8, 2025 (Evening)** - Documentation cleanup and archiving
