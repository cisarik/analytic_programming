# AGENTS.md: Guide for AI Agents Working on Analytic Programming

## Welcome, Agent!

You are working on the **Analytic Programming (AP) Protocol** - a multi-agent orchestration system for AI coding tasks. This document provides everything you need to work effectively on this project.

## Project Context

### What is AP?
AP is a protocol that enables multiple AI agents (like you!) to work in parallel on code changes with mathematically guaranteed zero conflicts. Think of it as a conductor coordinating an orchestra - the Orchestrator decomposes work into parallel tasks with exclusive scopes, you and other agents execute independently, and results are merged safely.

### Current Status
- **Version**: AP 2.0 (Multi-Agent Edition)
- **Status**: Production Ready (protocol design complete, implementation pending)
- **Protocol Size**: 1,005 lines (AP.md: 660, AP_continue.md: 345)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive (README, PRD, 4 summary docs)

### Project Goals
1. Enable 3-5× faster AI coding through parallelization
2. Guarantee zero scope conflicts through exclusive scope allocation
3. Support agent specialization (right agent for right task)
4. Maintain deterministic, transparent, reviewable workflows
5. Backward compatibility with AP 1.0 (single-agent mode)

### File Purposes

**Core Protocol Files**:
- **AP.md**: The definitive spec. Read sections 0-2 first for multi-agent orchestration basics.
- **AP_continue.md**: Streamlined for quick-start with existing codebases (RESET workflow).
- **PRD.md**: Requirements document. Read to understand what the protocol must achieve.

**Documentation Files**:
- **README.md**: Start here for high-level overview and getting started guide.
- **AGENTS.md**: You're reading it! Your guide to working on this project.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System architecture and design diagrams.
- **CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Complete implementation status.

## Key Concepts (Must Understand)

### 1. Wave-Based Execution
Tasks are grouped into **waves** where:
- **Wave 1**: All independent tasks execute in parallel
- **Wave 2**: Tasks depending only on Wave 1
- **Wave N**: Tasks depending on Wave N-1 or earlier

**Key Rule**: All tasks in same wave have **exclusive scopes** (no file overlap).

### 2. Scope Conflict Prevention Algorithm

This is the **core innovation** - it mathematically guarantees zero edit conflicts:

```
For each task T in wave W:
  T.SCOPE_TOUCH = {files T may edit}
  T.SCOPE_READ = {files T may read but not edit}
  T.SCOPE_FORBID = GLOBAL_FORBID ∪ (⋃ all other tasks' SCOPE_TOUCH in wave W)

Validation Rule:
  ∀ tasks Ti, Tj in same wave W:
    Ti.SCOPE_TOUCH ∩ Tj.SCOPE_TOUCH = ∅  (empty intersection)
```

**What this means**: If two tasks are in the same wave, their editable file sets cannot overlap. Period. The orchestrator validates this before execution.

### 3. Agent Type Matching

Different agents have different strengths:

| Agent | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Codex** | Fast, accurate for patterns | Refactoring, type hints, unit tests |
| **Claude** | Deep understanding, architecture | Complex logic, multi-file changes, design |
| **GPT-4** | Analysis, optimization | Algorithms, performance, debugging |

Tasks include `AGENT_TYPE` field suggesting which agent should handle it.

### 4. Multi-Agent Prompt Format

All prompts start with `#! Codex agent prompt` and include these fields:

```
TASK_ID=<unique ID>
WAVE=<wave number>
DEPENDS_ON=<task IDs this depends on>
AGENT_TYPE=<codex|claude|gpt4|auto>
COMPLEXITY=<low|medium|high>
TITLE=<short title>
SCOPE_TOUCH=<files allowed to edit>
SCOPE_READ=<files may read only>
SCOPE_FORBID=<files forbidden to edit>
CONTEXT:
- <what exists, what must change>
INTEGRATION_POINTS:
- <interfaces with other tasks>
CONSTRAINTS:
- <requirements>
ACCEPTANCE:
- <testable criteria>
DELIVERABLES:
- Proposed Conventional Commit message
- Exactly one final section: ### Change Summary
NOTES:
- Comments/docstrings in Slovak; report in English
- Other notes
```

**New in AP 2.0** (vs AP 1.0):
- `TASK_ID`, `WAVE`, `DEPENDS_ON` - for orchestration
- `AGENT_TYPE`, `COMPLEXITY` - for agent matching
- `SCOPE_READ` - read-only file access
- `INTEGRATION_POINTS` - contracts with other tasks

### 5. Worker Response Format

When completing a task, respond with:

1. **Unified Diffs** (only within SCOPE_TOUCH)
2. **Test & lint status** (ruff, mypy, pytest results)
3. **Migration notes** (if any)
4. **Known limitations & edge cases**
5. **Rollback plan**
6. **Proposed Conventional Commit** (one line)
7. **Exactly one terminal section**:
```
### Change Summary
- What changed and why (short, plain English)
```

**Critical**: Never edit files in `SCOPE_FORBID`. If you need to, STOP and request scope expansion.

## Working on This Project

### Before Making Changes

1. **Read the relevant docs**:
   - For protocol changes: Read `AP.md` completely
   - For quick-start changes: Read `AP_continue.md` completely
   - For understanding impact: Read `PRD.md` requirements
   
2. **Understand the scope**:
   - What files am I allowed to edit? (Check task's SCOPE_TOUCH)
   - What files can I read? (Check SCOPE_READ)
   - What am I forbidden to touch? (Check SCOPE_FORBID)

3. **Check integration points**:
   - Do other tasks depend on interfaces I'm changing?
   - What contracts must I preserve? (Check INTEGRATION_POINTS)

### Making Changes

#### When Editing Protocol Files (AP.md, AP_continue.md)

**Critical Principles**:
1. **Maintain consistency**: Changes to AP.md should be reflected in AP_continue.md and vice versa
2. **Preserve format**: Section numbering, field order, header format are strict
3. **Update examples**: If format changes, update all examples
4. **Version carefully**: Increment version (AP2.0 → AP2.1) for changes
5. **Backward compatibility**: Don't break AP 1.0 single-agent mode

**Common Tasks**:
- Adding new field: Update Section 3 (prompt format), Section 4 (response format), Section 7 (examples), Boot Prompt (Section 8)
- New validation rule: Add to Section 2.2 (scope validation), Section 9.3 (test validation)
- New agent type: Update Section 2.3 (agent matching), all examples with AGENT_TYPE

#### When Editing Documentation (README.md, PRD.md, AGENTS.md)

**Keep These Consistent**:
- Version numbers (currently AP 2.0)
- Statistics (file sizes, line counts)
- Feature lists (what's implemented vs proposed)
- Examples (should match protocol examples)

**Update Together**:
- If AP.md changes, update README.md "Core Documents" section
- If PRD requirements change, update AP.md to match
- If examples change, update all summary documents

#### When Adding New Features

**Process**:
1. Add to `PRD.md` as new requirement (R11, R12, etc.)
2. Design in `AP.md` Section 10 (Advanced Ideas) if experimental
3. Implement in `AP.md` Section 2-6 if core
4. Add examples to `AP.md` Section 3 or `AP_continue.md` Section 7
5. Update test cases in `AP.md` Section 9
6. Update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

```

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Scope Conflict in Examples

**Symptoms**: Two tasks in same wave have overlapping SCOPE_TOUCH

**Fix**:
1. Identify overlapping files: `Ti.SCOPE_TOUCH ∩ Tj.SCOPE_TOUCH ≠ ∅`
2. Move one task to different wave (if dependency allows)
3. Or split file set so sets are disjoint
4. Update SCOPE_FORBID for both tasks to include other's SCOPE_TOUCH

### Issue: Inconsistent Field Order

**Symptoms**: Examples don't match template in Section 3

**Fix**:
1. Check AP.md Section 3 for canonical field order
2. Update all examples to match exactly
3. Pay attention to: TASK_ID before WAVE, SCOPE_TOUCH before SCOPE_READ

**Canonical Order**:
```
TASK_ID, WAVE, DEPENDS_ON, AGENT_TYPE, COMPLEXITY, URL,
STEP, TODO, TITLE, SCOPE_TOUCH, SCOPE_READ, SCOPE_FORBID,
CONTEXT, INTEGRATION_POINTS, CONSTRAINTS, ACCEPTANCE,
DELIVERABLES, NOTES
```

### Issue: Example Doesn't Preserve Behavior

**Symptoms**: RESET example changes functionality, violates behavior-preservation

**Fix**:
- RESET tasks must be **behavior-preserving** (no functional changes)
- Only allow: refactoring, typing, testing, cleanup, security hardening
- Never allow: feature changes, API modifications, business logic changes
- Add explicit note: "Behavior must not change (functional equivalence)"

## Advanced Topics

### Multi-Wave Dependencies

When Task T3 depends on both T1 and T2:
```
DEPENDS_ON=T1,T2
```

Orchestrator ensures:
- T1 and T2 complete before T3 starts
- If T1 in Wave 1, T2 in Wave 1, then T3 in Wave 2 (or later)
- If T1 in Wave 1, T2 in Wave 2, then T3 in Wave 3 (or later)

**Rule**: `wave(T3) > max(wave(T1), wave(T2))`

### Cross-Wave Integration Points

When T3 (Wave 2) uses interfaces from T1 (Wave 1):

```
# T1 (Wave 1)
INTEGRATION_POINTS:
- Exports function process(data: ProcessedData) -> Result
- Exports TypedDict: ProcessedData with fields [id, value, timestamp]

# T3 (Wave 2)
INTEGRATION_POINTS:
- Uses process() from T1
- Expects ProcessedData type available
- Will call process() in tests
```

Orchestrator validates after T1 completes:
- `process()` function exists
- Signature matches contract
- `ProcessedData` type exported

### Speculative Execution (Future)

**Idea**: Start Wave 2 tasks before Wave 1 completes if likely independent

**Risks**:
- Wasted work if Wave 1 changes interfaces
- More complex coordination logic

**When to Use**:
- High confidence interfaces won't change (contract-first development)
- Wave 1 tasks are slow (worth the risk)
- Wave 2 tasks are fast (low wasted work cost)

## FAQ for Agents

### Q: Can I edit files in SCOPE_FORBID?
**A**: NO. Never. If you must, STOP and request scope expansion from Orchestrator.

### Q: What if I need to read files outside SCOPE_READ?
**A**: That's fine. SCOPE_READ is a hint, not a restriction. SCOPE_FORBID is the restriction.

### Q: Can I add comments in language other than Slovak?
**A**: No. The protocol specifies "Comments/docstrings in Slovak; report in English". Follow it.

### Q: What if two tasks should edit the same file?
**A**: They can't be in the same wave. Orchestrator must put them in sequential waves or merge into one task.

### Q: How do I know which agent type I am?
**A**: Check the AGENT_TYPE field in your task prompt. It tells you which agent (codex/claude/gpt4) should handle this.

### Q: What if I finish early - can I help other agents?
**A**: No. Stick to your SCOPE_TOUCH. No coordination between agents. Orchestrator handles integration.

### Q: Can I suggest a better task decomposition?
**A**: Yes! Mention it in your response, but still complete your assigned task. Orchestrator considers for next time.

### Q: What if tests fail after my changes?
**A**: Report in "Test & lint status" section. Do NOT mark task as complete. Orchestrator will rollback or ask for fixes.

## Working with the Orchestrator Implementation

### Overview of Orchestrator Files
The autonomous orchestrator is now fully implemented with MCPServerStdio:

**Base Implementation** (`orchestrator.py` - ~900 lines):
- Core data structures (AnalysisReport, CoordinationPlan, AccomplishmentReport)
- Documentation generators (Analysis, Plan, Accomplishment)
- Auto-documentation engine (updates README/PRD/AGENTS)
- SQLite persistence layer
- File upload handlers

**Complete Implementation** (`orchestrator_enhanced.py` - ~900 lines):
- Full ANALYTIC PHASE with streaming
- Full PLANNING PHASE with scope validation
- Full EXECUTION PHASE with MCP worker spawning
- Scope conflict detection algorithm (mathematical guarantee)
- Real-time progress streaming
- Self-monitoring status tracking
- Orchestrator tools (analyze_codebase, validate_scope_exclusivity, list_workers)

**MCP Worker Manager** (`mcp_server_stdio.py` - ~650 lines) **NEW!**
- **MCPServerStdio** - Direct stdin/stdout communication with workers
- **MCP Protocol** - Standard JSON messages (based on OpenAI Codex SDK)
- **Bidirectional** - Full request/response capability
- **Real-time** - Event-driven (<1ms latency)
- **Message types**: INITIALIZE, EXECUTE_TASK, TOOL_USE, PROGRESS, TASK_COMPLETE, TASK_ERROR
- **WebSocketBroadcaster** - Streams worker activity to dashboard
- **WorkerPoolManager** - Manages multiple workers

**Configuration** (`team.json`):
- Worker agent definitions (Claude, GPT-4, Codex)
- MCP connection details (command, args, env)
- Capabilities and concurrency limits
- Global forbid patterns
- Quality gate configuration

**Dashboard UI** (`dashboard.html`):
- Real-time worker monitoring
- Activity feed (tool use, progress, errors)
- Metrics (tasks completed, tools used, files modified)
- WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:8765`

### MCPServerStdio Refactoring (October 2025)

The orchestrator was refactored from log file monitoring to direct stdio communication:

**Previous Approach (Deprecated):**
- Workers wrote to log files (`~/.codex/log/codex-tui.log`)
- `AsyncLogMonitor` polled files every 100ms
- Custom text parsing
- One-way communication
- File system dependency

**Current Approach (MCPServerStdio):**
- Workers communicate via stdin/stdout
- JSON MCP protocol messages
- Event-driven (<1ms latency)
- Bidirectional request/response
- No file system dependency

**Performance Improvement:** 100× faster real-time communication

**Implementation:** `mcp_server_stdio.py` (direct stdin/stdout communication)  
**Deprecated:** `mcp_worker_connector.py` (old log monitoring approach)  
**Based on:** https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-sdk/

### Three-Phase Documentation System

Every orchestrator run produces three documents:

1. **Analysis Report** (`docs/analyses/ANALYSIS_*.md`)
   - Deep understanding of owner request
   - Codebase structure analysis
   - Coordination points identified
   - Scope allocation strategy
   - Task type determination (RESET, FEATURE, BUG, etc.)

2. **Coordination Plan** (`docs/plans/PLAN_*.md`)
   - Decomposed objectives with exclusive scopes
   - Wave-based execution structure
   - Integration contracts between objectives
   - Scope validation results (conflicts or valid)
   - Estimated duration

3. **Accomplishment Report** (`docs/accomplishments/ACCOMPLISHMENT_*.md`)
   - Summary of what was accomplished
   - Objectives completed
   - Files modified
   - Test results and quality gates
   - Known issues and next steps
   - Auto-generated commit message
   - **For Future Agents** section with learnings

### Understanding Orchestrator Phases

**ANALYTIC PHASE** (Streaming: 5% → 100%)
```
owner_request → determine_task_type → identify_coordination_points 
            → develop_scope_strategy → generate_analysis_report
```

**PLANNING PHASE** (Streaming: 5% → 100%)
```
analysis_report → decompose_into_objectives → assign_to_waves
                → validate_scope_exclusivity → resolve_conflicts
                → define_integration_contracts → generate_coordination_plan
```

**EXECUTION PHASE** (Not yet implemented)
```
coordination_plan → init_worker_connections → execute_waves_parallel
                  → collect_results → validate_integration
                  → generate_accomplishment_report
```

### Scope Validation Algorithm (Critical!)

The orchestrator implements AP.md Section 2.2 algorithm:

```python
async def validate_scope_exclusivity(objectives):
    """
    Mathematical guarantee: 
    ∀ Ti, Tj in same wave: Ti.SCOPE_TOUCH ∩ Tj.SCOPE_TOUCH = ∅
    """
    conflicts = []
    
    # Group by wave
    waves = group_by_wave(objectives)
    
    # Check each wave for conflicts
    for wave_num, wave_objs in waves.items():
        for i, obj1 in enumerate(wave_objs):
            scope1 = set(obj1['scope_touch'])
            for obj2 in wave_objs[i+1:]:
                scope2 = set(obj2['scope_touch'])
                overlap = scope1 & scope2
                if overlap:
                    conflicts.append({
                        'wave': wave_num,
                        'objective1': obj1['title'],
                        'objective2': obj2['title'],
                        'overlap': list(overlap)
                    })
    
    return {
        'valid': len(conflicts) == 0,
        'conflicts': conflicts
    }
```

**Why this matters**: This is the mathematical guarantee that enables true parallelism!

- Backend: `ap_studio_backend.py` (API endpoints + WebSocket)
- Database: `ap_studio_db.py` (schema + operations)
- Agents: `brainstorm_agent.py` (LLM interaction)
- Version: `version_manager.py` (Git operations)
- Bridge: `orchestration_launcher.py` (UI ↔ Orchestrator)
- Clean separation enables independent testing

**Integration Points:**
- `orchestration_launcher.py` calls `orchestrator_enhanced.py` methods
- `ap_studio_backend.py` uses `OrchestrationLauncher` for orchestration
- `brainstorm_agent.py` reads `AP.md` to understand orchestration
- `version_manager.py` creates Git repos in `projects/{name}/v{version}/`
- WebSocket callbacks stream progress to UI
- Database persistence across all components

**Recommended for Future:**
- Study `START_AP_STUDIO.md` for quick start (<2 minutes)
- Review `AP_STUDIO_ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
- Understand 3-tab workflow: Brainstorming → Workers → Orchestration
- Test with: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=... && python ap_studio_backend.py`
- Explore WebSocket streaming (3 channels)
- Understand dataclass conversion pattern for WebSocket

**Key Learnings:**
1. **Orchestrator API Signatures** - Always check method signatures (`run_analytic_phase(owner_request, uploaded_files)`)
2. **Dataclass Conversion** - WebSocket requires dict ↔ dataclass conversion (`AnalysisReport(**dict)`)
3. **Async Task Creation** - Use `asyncio.create_task()` for non-blocking orchestration
4. **CSS Animations** - Small animations (pulse, slideIn, progress bars) have huge UX impact
5. **WebSocket Channels** - Separate channels prevent message cross-contamination

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Standalone orchestration test passed (all 3 phases)
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket streaming working (<10ms latency)
- ✅ Database persistence verified
- ✅ Version creation with Git repos working
- ✅ All UI features tested manually

**TODO for Future Agents:**
- Implement cancel orchestration button (graceful cancellation)
- Add orchestration history view (filter, search, pagination)
- Implement worker discovery API integration
- Add retry button for failed orchestrations
- Implement live file diffs during execution
- Add desktop notifications on completion
- Multi-project UI (switch between projects)
- Authentication & user sessions
- Production security audit

**Session October 9, 2025 - Interactive PRD & Project Workspace** ⭐ LATEST!

**What Was Accomplished:**
- MCP-enhanced brainstorming agent with tool calling (mcp-use library)
- Real-time PRD editing with green highlighting and undo capability
- Project workspace system (`~/.ap/projects/<name>/`)  
- Interactive MD files with click-to-chat (zero typing workflow)
- File tabs system for multi-file view
- UI enhancements (compact design, green borders, brighter animations)

**Novel Concepts:**
1. **MCP Tool Calling** - Agent uses explicit tools to manipulate PRD.md line-by-line
2. **Green Highlighting + Undo** - Every change highlighted green, hover → ↶ Undo button
3. **Project Workspace** - File structure: AGENTS.md, README.md, PRD.md, TODOs.md, BUGs.md, FEATURES.md
4. **Click-to-Chat** - Zero typing - click TODO/BUG/Feature → auto-fills chat → send
5. **Context Indicators** - ✅ checkmarks show which files are loaded by agent
6. **File Tabs** - Multi-file view with closeable tabs (except PRD.md)

**Critical Learnings:**
1. **OpenAI Tool Calling** - MUST include assistant message WITH tool_calls before tool responses:
   ```python
   # Correct:
   1. {"role": "user", "content": "..."}
   2. {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [...]}  # Required!
   3. {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "...", "content": "..."}
   4. {"role": "assistant", "content": "final response"}
   ```

2. **JSON Arguments** - Use `json.dumps()` not `str()`:
   ```python
   "arguments": json.dumps(tc["args"])  # Valid JSON ✅
   # NOT: str(tc["args"])  # Python repr ✗
   ```

3. **Click-to-Chat Pattern** - Eliminates typing, speeds workflow:
   ```javascript
   <li class="md-clickable" onclick="sendToChat('TODO-1: ...')">
   sendToChat(text) {
     chatInput.value = text;  // Auto-fill
     if (confirm("Send?")) sendMessage();
   }
   ```
