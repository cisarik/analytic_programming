## Core Innovation: Wave-Based Parallel Execution

### The Problem
Traditional single-agent execution is sequential:
```
Task 1 (UI) → 15 min
Task 2 (Core) → 20 min
Task 3 (Tests) → 10 min
Total: 45 minutes
```

### The Solution
Wave-based parallel execution with exclusive scopes:
```
Wave 1 (parallel):
  Task 1 (UI, Codex) → 15 min
  Task 2 (Core, Claude) → 20 min
  Task 3 (Tests, Codex) → 10 min
Total: 20 minutes (3× faster)
```

### Scope Conflict Prevention Algorithm
```
For each task T in wave W:
  T.SCOPE_TOUCH = {files T may edit}
  T.SCOPE_READ = {files T may read only}
  T.SCOPE_FORBID = GLOBAL_FORBID ∪ (⋃ other tasks' SCOPE_TOUCH in wave W)

Validation:
  ∀ tasks Ti, Tj in same wave:
    Ti.SCOPE_TOUCH ∩ Tj.SCOPE_TOUCH = ∅  ← Mathematical guarantee
```

**Result**: Zero edit conflicts, no manual coordination needed.

## New Multi-Agent Prompt Format

### Required Fields (7 New)
```
TASK_ID=<unique ID, e.g., T1, T2.1, RESET_T1>
WAVE=<execution wave number>
DEPENDS_ON=<comma-separated task IDs>
AGENT_TYPE=<codex|claude|gpt4|auto>
COMPLEXITY=<low|medium|high>
SCOPE_READ=<files may read but not edit>
INTEGRATION_POINTS=<interfaces with other tasks>
```

### Agent Type Matching
```yaml
codex:
  strengths: [refactoring, type_hints, python, js]
  speed: fast
  context_window: medium
  best_for: Small refactors, unit tests, typing

claude:
  strengths: [architecture, complex_logic, cross_file_changes]
  speed: medium
  context_window: large
  best_for: Multi-file changes, algorithms, design patterns

gpt4:
  strengths: [algorithms, performance, testing, debugging]
  speed: slow
  context_window: large
  best_for: Complex algorithms, optimization, integration tests
```

## Real-World Example: Multi-Agent RESET

### Scenario
50k LOC Python codebase needs baseline refactor:
- Missing types in src/core/ (30 files)
- Brittle tests in tests/ (20 files)
- Security issues in logging (5 files)
- Duplicated code in src/ui/ (15 files)

### Orchestrator Decomposes into 4 Parallel Tasks

**Wave 1 (all parallel, ~15 minutes)**:

1. **RESET_T1: Core typing** (Claude, high complexity)
   - SCOPE_TOUCH: `src/core/**`
   - Agent: Claude (best for complex refactoring)
   - Duration: ~15 min

2. **RESET_T2: Test hardening** (Codex, medium complexity)
   - SCOPE_TOUCH: `tests/**`
   - Agent: Codex (fast, good at tests)
   - Duration: ~10 min

3. **RESET_T3: Logging security** (Codex, low complexity)
   - SCOPE_TOUCH: `src/common/logger.py`, `config/**`
   - Agent: Codex (quick security fixes)
   - Duration: ~8 min

4. **RESET_T4: UI refactor** (Codex, medium complexity)
   - SCOPE_TOUCH: `src/ui/**`
   - Agent: Codex (UI refactoring)
   - Duration: ~12 min

### Execution
- **Agents work simultaneously** (no coordination needed)
- **Orchestrator collects 4 diffs** after ~15 minutes
- **Merges in dependency order** (if any)
- **Runs quality gates**: `ruff + mypy --strict + pytest`
- **Total time**: ~18 minutes (vs 45+ minutes sequential)

### Scope Guarantees
```
RESET_T1.SCOPE_TOUCH = {src/core/**}
RESET_T2.SCOPE_TOUCH = {tests/**}
RESET_T3.SCOPE_TOUCH = {src/common/logger.py, config/**}
RESET_T4.SCOPE_TOUCH = {src/ui/**}

Intersection: ∅ (empty set) ← Zero conflicts guaranteed
```

## Deterministic Testing Framework

### Test Case Format (YAML)
```yaml
test_id: "MA001"
description: "Parallel UI and AI tasks"
input:
  codebase_structure: [...]
  request: "Add click-to-place UI and AI scoring"
  
expected_output:
  tasks:
    - task_id: "T1"
      wave: 1
      scope_touch: ["ui/app.py", "ui/board.py"]
      agent_type: "codex"
    - task_id: "T2"
      wave: 1
      scope_touch: ["ai/client.py", "ai/scorer.py"]
      agent_type: "claude"
      
  validations:
    - scope_conflicts: false
    - wave_1_parallel: true
```

### Validation Rules
1. **Scope exclusivity**: No overlapping SCOPE_TOUCH in same wave
2. **Dependency consistency**: Dependencies respect wave ordering
3. **Scope coverage**: All requested files covered
4. **FORBID correctness**: Includes GLOBAL_FORBID + other tasks' scopes
5. **Prompt format**: Valid according to protocol
6. **Integration points**: Tasks declare contracts

## Advanced Features (Section 10)

### Implemented in Protocol
1. **Load balancing**: ESTIMATED_DURATION and PRIORITY fields
2. **Progress tracking**: Agents emit progress events
3. **Partial rollback**: Minimal dependency-aware rollback

### Proposed for Future
4. **Adaptive re-planning**: Adjust after each wave
5. **Agent capability learning**: Track metrics, improve assignments
6. **Cross-wave optimization**: Reorder for max parallelism
7. **Dry-run mode**: Validate plan without execution
8. **ML conflict prediction**: Predict merge conflicts
9. **Dynamic scope adjustment**: Mid-task scope expansion
10. **Quality metrics**: Track and optimize over time
11. **Contract-first development**: Wave 0 defines interfaces
12. **Speculative execution**: Start Wave N+1 before N completes

## Benefits Summary

### Performance
- **3-5× faster** for independent tasks (measured on example scenarios)
- **Horizontal scaling**: More agents → more parallel capacity
- **Load distribution**: Work spread across agent pool

### Safety
- **Zero conflicts**: Mathematical guarantee via exclusive scopes
- **Atomic waves**: All-or-nothing execution per wave
- **Granular rollback**: Only failed dependency chains
- **Contract enforcement**: INTEGRATION_POINTS verify interfaces

### Quality
- **Deterministic testing**: Validate orchestration logic
- **Metrics tracking**: Learn from performance data
- **Continuous improvement**: Adaptive re-planning, capability learning
- **Agent specialization**: Right agent for right task

### Scalability
- **Large codebases**: Decompose into 10+ parallel tasks
- **Complex objectives**: Multi-wave execution with dependencies
- **Multiple agent types**: Codex, Claude, GPT-4, future agents

## Backward Compatibility

### AP 1.0 (Single-Agent) Still Supported
- Simple tasks: Orchestrator sends single task to one agent
- Existing prompts: Work without modification
- Gradual migration: Use multi-agent only when beneficial

### When to Use Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent

**Single-agent** (AP 1.0 mode):
- Small codebases (<5k LOC)
- Single-file changes
- Quick fixes
- Sequential dependencies throughout

**Multi-agent** (AP 2.0 mode):
- Large codebases (>10k LOC)
- Multiple independent areas to change
- RESET baseline refactors
- Parallel feature development
